My primary aim in teaching theatre history is to make history significant for my students’ present. To do that, I emphasize the interplay between performance and culture: how theatre can be used to understand society and how social dynamics influence theatre making at different points in time.

## Theatre 140-2: Performance Analysis
### Dancing Race

Identity categories are visibly and palpably inscribed onto performing bodies. In this course we focus on dancing bodies and their racial implications. How can dancing bodies in the theatre, in the club, and on the street convey ideas of race and racial politics? This course covers dance styles and genres spanning from the 1920s to the present, and emphasizes works by African American, Jewish American, and Asian American choreographers/performers.

Readings are complemented by visual documentation and live performance to help us develop specific vocabularies to describe, assess, and critique movement. This class introduces students to university-level research paper writing that incorporates performance analysis and secondary sources.

## Theatre 341-0: American Theatre History
### Theatre & Revolution

Revolution never originates in a vacuum. As the Latin origin of the word suggests, revolutions “reflect upon the past” to change the future. In this course, we learn about the history of theatre in terms of “revolutions” or moments of change. How did audience behavior change once the proscenium stage was introduced? How did acting change once microphones became available? In parallel, we inquire about how theatre can be the catalyst of change in the world. How was the dramatic medium utilized to incite political discussion leading to the American Revolution? How did conceptions of race change with the introduction of blackface minstrelsy? And how have understandings of sexuality changed since plays like <i>Angels in America</i>?

In this class we learn to reconstruct historical events from a variety of primary sources, and to read history with an eye towards how “revolution” as a hermeneutic can shape the way the historical narrative is constructed. How does a focus on moments of change shape the way we understand and write theatre history? This course shows students how history is never just a set of facts, but a critical stance on the past.
