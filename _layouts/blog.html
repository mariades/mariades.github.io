							Popular entertainment is a powerful influencer of society. To gain a comprehensive understanding of its communication potential, I study the history of many different forms of popular entertainment, both in the United States and abroad.

						</p>
						<p>
						My dissertation research explores racial images in American popular entertainment, how they create meaning on stage, and how the audience interprets them. I explore these questions in the context of vaudeville, the first American entertainment industry that gathered international artists and socially, economically, and ethnically diverse audiences.

						</p>

						<p>
						I am a trained ballet dancer and since starting my PhD at Northwestern, I have been complementing my practice with theoretical and historical explorations in the field of dance studies. Researching dance has allowed me to delve deeper into questions of racial perception. Dancing bodies often communicate racial meanings more directly than any dramatic piece or staging device. I translate this awareness into my dissertation work by paying particular attention to the way bodies move, pose, and stage themselves for an audience.

						My work as Associate Editor for the collection <i>Three Loves for Three Oranges: Gozzi, Meyerhold, Prokofiev</i> reveals the influence that popular entertainment has on highbrow performance forms such as Opera. This rich collection of essays is the first book to expose the intertwined legacy of Sergei Prokofiev’s 1921 opera <i>Love for Three Oranges</i>, the 1913 play by the same title adapted by Vsevolod Meyerhold from Carlo Gozzi, and Gozzi’s 1761 original <i>commedia dell’arte</i> piece.
