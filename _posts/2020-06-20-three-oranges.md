This book reconstructs Sergei Prokofiev’s opera <i>Love for Three Oranges</i> (1921) and its genealogy in Vsevolod Meyerhold’s 1913 theatrical divertissement (<i>Liubov’ k trem apel’sinam</i>) and Carlo Gozzi’s 1761 theatrical fairytale (<i>L’amore delle tre melarance</i>). The book reveals that Gozzi’s, Meyerhold’s, and Prokofiev’s innovative approach to theatre and opera has a deeply intertwined legacy. Divided into three sections, the book also addresses key aspects of the individual artist’s work that have yet to receive their due attention: Gozzi’s staging techniques and relationship with his actors, Meyerhold’s experiments with commedia dell’arte, and Prokofiev’s place in the 1920s American craze for Russian and Soviet music.


My contribution to the book’s general introduction and annotated translation of Carlo Gozzi’s play reflect my archival work at the Marciana National Library in Venice, where a wealth of unpublished writings by Gozzi has been recently made available for research. These manuscripts challenge the long-accepted image of Gozzi as an amateur playwright and instead reveal his close collaborations with Venetian commedia dell’arte actors.

The book gathers contributions by international scholars and original English translations of the three theatrical works. It is timed to appear in 2021 for the centenary of the Chicago world premiere of Prokofiev’s opera.
