My dissertation examines racial impersonation, a performance genre that originated in 19th-century blackface minstrelsy. During the peak of American immigration between 1880 and 1924, popular entertainers expanded their repertoires to include not only belittling depictions of African Americans but the variety of other races and ethnicities entering the United States. During these years, artists of Irish, Chinese, and Jewish heritage began to replace American-born impersonators. The economic profitability of racial impersonation encouraged broad participation, but was the incentive for immigrant performers purely financial? My research shows the extent to which immigrant artists deliberately coopted the genre of racial impersonation to combat dominant racial stereotypes and articulate their own identities at a time when the concept of "hyphenated identity" was still very much in formation.

Immigrant impersonators allowed their spectators to imagine hyphenated subjecthoods as viable alternatives to bifurcated American identities that are either foreign or White. They did so by performing their immigrant identities both formally in the theatre and informally in their everyday interactions with immigration law.  They utilized makeup, costumes, and repertoires of songs and jokes for the former, and dress, accents, and bearing as explicit racial signifiers for the latter, especially when these took place in front of immigration officials at national borders. My analyses contrast theatrical racial impersonations and “everyday” self-presentations at the border to expose the power of racial impersonation to influence not only theatre audiences’ understandings of race, but also the drafting and administration of immigration law. In fact, my dissertation argues, performance, racial, and cultural values have long been implicated in producing concrete immigration policies and enforcement strategies.

My comparative work crosses racial, ethnic, and national identities (of the performers and their characters), genders, and immigration waves. As a result, my dissertation contributes transnational, transracial, and transgenerational dimensions to the histories of American entertainment and immigration, while underscoring the political power of theatre arts, the performative dimension of law enforcement, and how the two inform one another.
