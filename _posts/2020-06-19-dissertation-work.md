My dissertation examines racial impersonation, a performance genre that originated in 19th-century blackface minstrelsy. During the peak of American immigration between 1880 and 1924, popular entertainers expanded their repertoires to include not only belittling depictions of African Americans but the variety of other races and ethnicities entering the United States. During these years, artists of Irish, Chinese, and Jewish heritage began to replace American-born impersonators. The economic profitability of racial impersonation encouraged broad participation, but was the incentive for immigrant performers purely financial?


This research shows the extent to which immigrant artists deliberately coopted the genre of racial impersonation to combat dominant racial stereotypes and articulate their own identities at a time when the concept of "hyphenated identity" was still very much in formation.


My comparative work crosses racial, ethnic, and national identities (of the performers and their characters), genders, and immigration waves. As a result, my dissertation contributes transnational, transracial, and transgenerational dimensions to the histories of American entertainment and immigration.
