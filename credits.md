Three distinct sets of experiences have prepared me to mentor university students: my training as a selected participant in the Social Science Research Council Dissertation Proposal Development (SSRC DPD) program; my work as Global Café Mentor for Northwestern International Studies program and, most recently, my year-long mentorship duties for Northwetswern’s Office of Fellowships.

The SSRC DPD program emphasizes a proven protocol for writing and revising research proposals. The strategies I cultivated to articulate my research for a broad audience and provide constructive critique to my peers have been instrumental for the advancement of my mentorship and pedagogy.

As Global Café Mentor, I assisted students in the development of research projects and international research skills. Moreover, I planned and coordinated a weekly speaker series to expose undergraduates to research in International Studies.

My work at the Office of Fellowships gave me familiarity with multiple academic funding sources, their missions, and application processes. I was able to share this knowledge with dozens of undergraduates and help them brainstorm, edit, and polish their grant writing.
